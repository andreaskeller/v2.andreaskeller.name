## Why would I need Google Sheets as a CMS?

Recently I had the need to add FAQ's to a simple Next.js landing page without a CMS. The FAQ's needed to be updated by another user, but I didn't want to set up a CMS only for this. So I ended up using Google Sheets and I'm more than happy with the solution. Thanks to Incremental Static Regeneration of Next.js I get a fast static site which still gets updated whenever FAQ's are changed.

In this blog post I show you how to load content from Google Sheets and add it to your Next.js site. Let's get started by setting up the Google Sheets API.

## Create a new Google project and credentials

Go to https://console.developers.google.com.

Create a new project and give it a name.

Go to APIs & Services and select Credentials, then Manage Service Accounts.

Click _CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT_ and give the service account a name. Click _DONE_.

In the list of your service accounts, click the three bullets under _Action_ and click _Create Key_. Choose _JSON_ and click _CREATE_.

Store the created JSON file with your service account credentials somewhere save. We will later on extract the needed fields and save them in our environment variables.

## Enable Google Sheets API

To use the Google Sheets API we first need to enable it for this project. Search for Google Sheets in the searchbox. Open the overview page and click the _ENABLE API_ button.

Now we should be ready to use Google Sheets API in our code.

## Create a Google Sheet

Open sheets.google.com and create a new sheet to store our data or you could open this [sample sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCfb-T2bXPv5BuqUxyrWIHUWdlh8AajiJKgQAB7yOi8) and save a copy (File - Make a copy).

We are rebuilding the reasons listed on the nextjs.org website why Next.js is awesome.

</a>

## Share Google Sheet with service account

To access our data we need to share our Google Sheet with our service account we created in the previous step. Click the _Share_ button topright, copy the client_email adress from your service account JSON file and paste it into the textbox. Select Viewer as permission as we only need to read data.

## Setup a new Next.js app

Setup a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS already configured as we use it to style our app.

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss google-sheets-cms
```

## Setup environment variables

Create a file `.env.local` and add the two values client_email and private_key from your service accounts file.

```
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=YOUR CLIENT EMAIL
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR PRIVATE KEY
```

It's important to replace the escaped `\n` characters when reading the private key environment variable like so:

```js
process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\n/g, "\n");
```

## Create a function to read data from our Google Sheet

To use the Google Sheets API we need to install the library _googleapis_. Install it by running

```bash
yarn add googleapis
```

Create a folder _lib_ and add a file _api.js_ to it.

```js:lib/api.js
import { google } from "googleapis";

export async function getWhyNextReasons() {
  try {
    const scopes = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly"];
    const jwt = new google.auth.JWT(
      process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      null,
      // we need to replace the escaped newline characters
      // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50299329/node-js-firebase-service-account-private-key-wont-parse
      process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\n/g, "\n"),
      scopes
    );

    const sheets = google.sheets({ version: "v4", auth: jwt });
    const response = await sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
      spreadsheetId: process.env.SPREADSHEET_ID,
      range: "Why Next.js?",
    });

    const rows = response.data.values;

    if (rows.length) {
      return rows.map((row) => ({
        title: row[0],
        description: row[1],
        href: row[2] || null,
      }));
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }

  return [];
}
```

We first need to define the required scopes for our app. In our case we only need read access. We define that with this line:

```js
const scopes = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly"];
```

Next we need to provide the client email and private key of our service account to generate a JWT (Json Web Token) which we need to initalize the api in the next step.

```js
const jwt = new google.auth.JWT(
  process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL,
  null,
  // we need to replace the escaped newline characters
  // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50299329/node-js-firebase-service-account-private-key-wont-parse
  process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\n/g, "\n"),
  scopes
);
```

We initialize the Google Sheets API with

```js
const sheets = google.sheets({ version: "v4", auth: jwt });
```

We use the latest API version 4 and pass our created token.

After that we can load the data with

```js
const response = await sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
  spreadsheetId: process.env.SPREADSHEET_ID,
  range: "Why Next.js?",
});
```

We need to provide the Spreadsheet ID and a range. You can get the Spreadsheet ID from the URL of your Google Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET\*ID>/). The range can be only the Sheet Name (_Why Next.js?_ in our case) or could also further include a selection of rows/columns.

We map the columns to specific fields to make it clearer what data we are reading.

## Read the Google Sheets data in our index.js file

Next we want to read this data in our index.js file in the getStaticProps function. With using getStaticProps instead of getServerProps we get a fast static site and with Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration we still get a updated page after data has changed.

Change the default index.js file to this:

```js:pages/index.js
import Nav from "../components/nav";
import { getWhyNextReasons } from "../lib/api";

export default function IndexPage({ reasons }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Nav />
      <div className="container mx-auto py-20 px-8">
        <h1 className="text-5xl text-center text-accent-1 mb-16">Why Next.js?</h1>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          {reasons.slice(0, reasons.length - 1).map(({ title, description, href }) => (
            <a
              className="border border-grey-200 rounded p-4 hover:shadow-lg hover:border-transparent"
              key={title}
              href={href}
              target="_blank"
            >
              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">{title}</h3>
              <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: description }} />
              <span className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400 hover:underline mt-4 block">
                Documentation →
              </span>
            </a>
          ))}
        </div>
        <div className="text-center mt-8">
          {reasons.slice(reasons.length - 1).map(({ title, description }) => (
            <div className="markdown inline-p">
              <strong>{title}</strong> <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: description }} />
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const reasons = await getWhyNextReasons();

  return {
    props: {
      reasons,
    },
    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every second
    revalidate: 1, // In seconds
  };
}
```

We load the data from Google Sheets via our function `getWhyNextReasons` which we defined above in the getStaticProps function and pass it as props to our component.

We iterate over the reasons and style them with Tailwind CSS similar to how they are displayed on nextjs.org.

By passing `revalidate: 1` we regenerate the page in the background when a request comes in, so that we show the current version of our data.
