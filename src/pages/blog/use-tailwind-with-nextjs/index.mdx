Detailed instructions on how to use Tailwind in a Next.js app.

<!--/excerpt-->

## Start a new Next.js app with Tailwind

If you start a new app the fastest way to get started is with this single command.

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss my-new-project
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss my-new-project
```

This creates a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app already setup to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) including purging unused CSS and some other optimizations.

## Add Tailwind to an existing app

To add Tailwind to an existing Next.js app follow these steps:

```bash
npm install --save tailwindcss
# or
yarn add tailwindcss
```

Create a postcss.config.js file and add Tailwind as a plugin:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["tailwindcss"],
};
```

Create a CSS file (e.g. styles/index.css) and use the @tailwind directive to inject Tailwind's styles into your CSS:

```css
@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```

Import this CSS file into your pages/\_app.js. Create it, if you haven't already.

```jsx
import "../styles/index.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

With this minimal setup you are already up and running and can style your app with Tailwind. But you likely want to customise your Tailwind configuration. For that run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project. To learn more about Tailwind configuration go to the [Tailwind configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

### Purge unused Tailwind styles with PurgeCSS

To ship only the Tailwind styles you are using in your app you should configure the integrated PurgeCSS. For a Next.js app add all JSX files to the `purge` property in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

To ensure you don't accidentally purge important base styles, whitelist them by using PurgeCSS's [whitelisting](https://purgecss.com/whitelisting.html) feature. Change your `index.css` to this:

```css
/* purgecss start ignore */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
/* purgecss end ignore */

@tailwind utilities;
```

One other important caveat when enabling PurgeCSS is to avoid dynamically creating class strings in your code. Read more about writing purgeable HTML [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#writing-purgeable-html).

Have fun styling your Next.js app with Tailwind!
